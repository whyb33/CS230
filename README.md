Module 8 Portfolio Journal Entry

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
My client, The Gaming Room, wanted to turn their Android application "Draw It or Lose It" into a web-based game application with multi-platform support.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I made regular updates expanding on the development needs for this projects as well as my recommendations. I feel like my strongest contribution was laying out the development requirements for each platform along with comparing and contrasting them.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? Seeing how it needs to be both cross platform and secure highlighted the need for utilizing APIs which I had never done prior to this project or course.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would rework the design constraints portion to better focus on cloud platforms specifically.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I interpreted the user's needs as creating a cloud hosted web application. This is due to their expressed need for a multiplatform application as well as their lack of understanding in setting up an environment or knowing the hardware requirements. The client giving detailed specifications such as game states and the game flow was imperitive in understanding how to develop the application and completing the software design document.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I mostly utilized the UML diagram to understand the class structure needed. In the future, I would explore different patterns from the singleton, as this limits scalability. I would also try to make more use of APIs in the project.
